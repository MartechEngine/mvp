# MartechEngine - Task Ledger

**Task Update - 2025-08-01**

*   **COMPLETED:** **Fix User Authentication Flow in Dev**
    *   **Description:** Resolved a critical bug preventing login after user registration in the development environment. The issue was traced to an incorrect endpoint URL and a database connection problem during cleanup, not the email verification logic as initially suspected.
    *   **Impact:** The core user authentication cycle (signup -> login -> profile access) is now fully functional, unblocking further development of authenticated features.
    *   **Status:** âœ… Done

This file tracks the implementation of the architectural blueprint.

### Development Workflow

1.  **Select a Task:** Pick an unchecked task from the list below (e.g., `(1.4) 1.4-Docker-Setup.md`).
2.  **Read the Architecture:** Before starting development, thoroughly read the corresponding architecture file (e.g., `docs/architecture/1.4-Docker-Setup.md`).
3.  **Update Task (if needed):** Ensure the task description in this file accurately reflects the work defined in the architecture document. Keep it high-level.
4.  **Develop:** Implement the feature as described.
5.  **Update Project Docs:**
    *   **`JOURNAL.md`**: Log any significant findings, bugs, or ideas encountered during development.
    *   **`DECISIONS.md`**: If any implementation choice deviates from the architecture or requires a new significant decision, document the rationale here.
    *   **`ROADMAP.md`**: This file should only be updated when a major phase is completed.
6.  **Mark as Done:** Once development is complete and merged, mark the task as done `[x]`.
