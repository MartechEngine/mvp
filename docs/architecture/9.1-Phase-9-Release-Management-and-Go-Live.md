Phase: 9 - Go-Live
Part: 9.1 (Consolidated)
Title: Release Management & Production Go-Live Strategy
Depends On: 8.1-Phase-8-Operations-and-Compliance.md
Objective: To define the formal process for versioning, releasing, and deploying the application to production, ensuring zero downtime and a clear rollback path.
1. Branching & Versioning
Model: Adopt the GitFlow branching model (main, develop, feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*).
Versioning: All releases will follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
2. Deployment Strategy: Blue-Green
Process:
The CI/CD pipeline deploys the new version ("green") to Kubernetes alongside the current version ("blue").
Automated smoke tests run against the green deployment's internal service endpoint.
If tests pass, the Kubernetes Ingress is updated to switch live traffic to the green deployment.
The blue deployment is kept on standby for a monitoring period before being decommissioned.
Rollback: If any step fails, or if post-deployment monitoring shows issues, the Ingress is immediately reverted to the blue deployment.
3. Production Deployment Runbook (Checklist)
Pre-Deployment (T-60 min):
Verify release/* branch is merged to main and develop.
Confirm staging environment is healthy with the release candidate.
Announce deployment freeze in the team communication channel.
Verify production health and successful database backup.
Execution (T-0):
Trigger the production deployment workflow in GitHub Actions.
A designated release manager provides manual approval within the GitHub Actions UI.
Monitor the automated blue-green deployment pipeline.
Post-Deployment (T+15 min):
Verify the application version number on a public endpoint.
Closely monitor Grafana dashboards and Sentry for anomalies for 15 minutes.
Perform a manual smoke test of the core user journey (Login, Create Project, Start Scan).
Announce successful deployment and lift the freeze.
