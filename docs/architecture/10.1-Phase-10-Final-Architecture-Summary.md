Phase: 10 - Finalization
Part: 10.1
Title: Final Architecture Summary
Depends On: 9.1-Phase-9-Release-Management-and-Go-Live.md
Objective: To conclude the architectural review, summarize the critical decisions, and provide a high-level implementation roadmap.
1. Architecture Summary
This review process has produced a mature, secure, and scalable architectural blueprint for the MartechEngine MVP. All 192 previously identified gaps have been addressed, resulting in a cohesive and production-ready plan.
Key Architectural Pillars:
Subscription-First Monetization: The system is built around a 7-day free trial followed by a mandatory subscription to a paid plan before users can purchase add-on credits. All financial transactions are managed by an immutable, auditable credit ledger.
Asynchronous, Resilient Core Features: The core DCS scan is an asynchronous, Celery-based workflow with a resilient data-sourcing fallback chain, ensuring reliability and a responsive user experience.
Unified Data Contracts & Service Layers: Strict, shared data contracts (Pydantic/TypeScript) and a consistent service layer pattern (dependency injection, transactional integrity) are used throughout the backend.
Enterprise-Grade Testing & IaC: The entire application is supported by a multi-layered testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E) and an Infrastructure-as-Code approach using Helm and GitHub Actions for automated, repeatable environments.
2. High-Level Implementation Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the prioritized sequence for development.
Sprint 1-2: Core Backend & Authentication: Implement core data models (Auth, Billing, Projects) and build the complete backend authentication and user profile services and APIs.
Sprint 3-4: Frontend Foundation & Auth Flow: Set up the Next.js frontend, connect the full authentication and user profile lifecycle, and implement route protection.
Sprint 5-6: Project & Billing Implementation: Implement the backend project and billing services/APIs (including webhooks) and build the corresponding frontend UIs for project and billing management.
Sprint 7-8: Core DCS Engine: Implement the entire backend DCS workflow: external clients, the Celery orchestrator, the Project Memory service, and the real-time SSE progress API.
Sprint 9-10: Intelligence UI & Content Generation: Build the unified frontend scan results page, the CTA generation/execution services, and the supporting analysis services.
Sprint 11-12: Testing, Operations & Launch: Implement the full E2E test suite, execute the production deployment runbook, and prepare for launch.
