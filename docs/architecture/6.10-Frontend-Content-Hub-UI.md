Phase: 6 - Content & Analysis Suite
Part: 6.10
Title: Frontend Content Hub UI
Depends On: 6.9-Frontend-Intelligence-UI-Hooks.md
Objective: To design and implement the user interface for the Content Hub, the central workspace for all AI-powered content generation and management. This includes the UI for the Content Library (viewing existing content) and the Content Generator (creating new content from scratch or from a strategic opportunity).
1. Core Principle: A Seamless Creation Workflow
The Content Hub is designed to make content creation as seamless as possible. It serves two primary functions: acting as a repository for all generated assets and providing a powerful interface for creating new ones. The UI prioritizes clarity, ease of use, and providing the AI with the right context.
2. Custom Hooks for Content
The Content Hub will be powered by a new set of React Query hooks for fetching the content library and for mutating content (generating, updating, deleting).
File Location: frontend/src/hooks/useContent.ts
File Content:
import { useQuery, useMutation, useQueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';
// Assume a ContentService and types are created, similar to the IntelligenceService
import { ContentService } from '@/services/content.service'; 
import { GeneratedAsset, ContentGenerationPayload } from '@/types/intelligence';

// --- Query Key Factory ---
export const contentKeys = {
  all: (projectId: string) => ['content', projectId] as const,
  lists: (projectId: string) => [...contentKeys.all(projectId), 'list'] as const,
  list: (projectId: string, params: any) => [...contentKeys.lists(projectId), params] as const,
};

// --- Query Hooks ---
export const useContentLibrary = (projectId: string, params = {}) => {
  return useQuery<GeneratedAsset[], Error>({
    queryKey: contentKeys.list(projectId, params),
    queryFn: () => ContentService.getContentLibrary(projectId, params), // Assumes this service method exists
    enabled: !!projectId,
  });
};

// --- Mutation Hooks ---
// We can re-use useGenerateContent from useIntelligence.ts or create a dedicated one here.
3. Content Hub Page UI (/projects/{projectId}/content)
This page is the main container for the content features, using a tabbed interface.
File Location: frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[projectId]/content/page.tsx
Component Blueprint:
Header: "Content Hub" title.
Tabbed Interface:
Tab 1: Content Library (Default Tab): Displays a sortable, searchable data table of all content generated for the project.
Tab 2: Content Generator: The form for creating new content.
Primary CTA: A prominent + Generate New Content button in the header of the Content Library tab, which switches the user to the Content Generator tab.
4. Content Library Tab UI
This is the central repository for a project's generated content.
UI Blueprint for the Content Library Tab:
Main View: A rich data table component (e.g., from shadcn/ui or a similar library).
Table Columns:
Title/Content Snippet: A preview of the content.
Type: The type of asset (e.g., "Meta Tag", "LLM.txt").
Source: Which scan generated it.
Date Created.
Actions: A dropdown menu with options like "View/Copy", "Regenerate", "Delete".
Filtering/Searching: Controls to filter the table by asset type or search by content.
Empty State: If no content has been generated, a message prompts the user to "Generate your first piece of content from a DCS Scan to see it here."
5. Content Generator Tab UI
This is the interactive tool for generating new content. It's designed to be flexible, allowing users to start from scratch or from a strategic opportunity identified in another part of the app.
UI Blueprint for the Content Generator Tab:
Layout: A two-column layout.
Left Column (Input & Controls): Contains all the form fields and settings for the AI.
Right Column (Output): Displays the generated content once ready.
Input Form Fields:
Start from: A select dropdown ("A blank canvas", "A content gap opportunity", etc.).
Content Type: A select dropdown ("Blog Post", "Meta Description", "Social Media Post").
Topic/Prompt: The main text input for the user's topic. This field would be pre-filled if the user navigated from a "Write Article" CTA.
Target Keywords: A tag-based input for primary and secondary keywords.
Tone of Voice: A select dropdown ("Professional", "Casual", "Witty", etc.).
Credit Cost Display: A dynamic display that shows the estimated AI credit cost for the generation based on the selected content type.
Main CTA: A Generate Content (âš¡ [Cost] Credits) button. The button is disabled if the user has insufficient credits.
Output Area:
Initial State: A placeholder explaining that the generated content will appear here.
Loading State: A skeleton loader with a message like "Our AI is writing...".
Success State: A rich text editor displaying the generated content, with controls to "Copy", "Save to Library", or "Regenerate".
6. Conclusion of Phase 6
This file concludes the architectural work for the Content & Analysis Suite. We have now designed the complete backend and frontend architecture for the core value-delivery features of the application.
Next File: 7.1-Backend-Testing-Infrastructure.md will kick off the final phase, Enterprise Readiness & Finalization. It will establish a comprehensive, multi-layered testing infrastructure for the FastAPI backend to ensure the reliability and quality of all the services we've designed.
