Phase: 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure
Part: 1.5
Title: Enterprise Frontend Architecture Overview
Depends On: 1.4-Docker-Setup.md
Objective: To provide a high-level overview of the unified frontend architecture for the MartechEngine application. This document establishes the core principles of a modern, secure, and scalable UI foundation, focusing on efficient server state management and a clean, maintainable component structure.
1. Core Architectural Principles
Our frontend architecture is built on a clear separation of concerns, designed to be declarative, resilient, and performant.
Server State vs. Client State: We make a hard distinction between the two.
Server State: Data that lives on our backend (user profiles, projects, scan results). This is asynchronous. We will use @tanstack/react-query (formerly React Query) to manage 100% of this state.
Client State: Data that lives only in the browser (e.g., the state of a modal window, the content of a form). This will be managed by simple React hooks (useState, useReducer) or a lightweight store like Zustand for globally shared UI state.
Hooks as the Data Layer: UI components will never directly call our API. Instead, they will consume custom hooks (e.g., useProjects, useCurrentUser). This completely decouples our UI from the complexities of data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
Service Layer Abstraction: The custom hooks themselves will not contain data-fetching logic (like axios or fetch calls). Instead, they will call a dedicated API Service Layer, which provides a clean, testable interface for all backend communication.
2. Core Technology Stack
Component	Technology	Rationale
Framework	Next.js (with TypeScript)	Production-grade React framework with performance, SEO, and developer experience benefits via the App Router.
Styling	Tailwind CSS	Utility-first CSS for rapid, consistent, and maintainable styling.
Components	Shadcn/ui	Headless, accessible, and composable UI components for building a custom design system without being locked into a specific library.
Server State	@tanstack/react-query	The industry standard for managing server state, providing caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates out of the box.
Client State	Zustand	Minimalist global state management for shared UI state, used only when necessary.
Forms	React Hook Form & Zod	High-performance form management paired with schema-based validation for robustness and end-to-end type safety.
API Client	Axios	A powerful, promise-based HTTP client with interceptors for centralized authentication and error handling.
