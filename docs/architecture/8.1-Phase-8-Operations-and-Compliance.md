Phase: 8 - Enterprise Readiness & Finalization
Part: 8.1 (Consolidated)
Title: Consolidated Operations & Compliance Framework
Depends On: 7.3-Phase-7-Implementation-and-Testing-Strategy.md
Objective: To define the complete, actionable framework for all operational, security, and compliance aspects of the MartechEngine platform, ensuring it is ready for a production launch.
1. Observability Stack (Monitoring, Logging, Tracing)
Strategy: Implement a full observability stack using Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry, managed as code.
Metrics (Prometheus): Use prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator to automatically generate metrics for latency, requests, and errors, exposed via a /metrics endpoint on the backend.
Logging (structlog): Configure all Python services to emit structured, JSON-formatted logs for efficient parsing and analysis by a log aggregation service (e.g., Loki, Elasticsearch).
Tracing (OpenTelemetry): Use the opentelemetry-instrument runtime wrapper to auto-instrument FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Celery for end-to-end distributed tracing without significant code changes.
Alerting (Alertmanager): Define critical alert rules in a YAML file (e.g., high_error_rate, high_latency) that trigger notifications to a designated channel (e.g., Slack, PagerDuty).
2. Security & Rate Limiting
Strategy: Protect the API from abuse and ensure data integrity with a multi-layered security approach.
Rate Limiting (slowapi): Implement the slowapi library with a Redis backend. Apply a global limit to anonymous users via middleware and stricter, user-specific limits to sensitive endpoints (e.g., login, content generation) via decorators.
Audit Trail: Create a SecurityAuditLog model. Use a custom @audit_log decorator to asynchronously dispatch events (e.g., LOGIN_SUCCESS, PROJECT_CREATED) to a dedicated Celery queue. A worker then writes these events to the append-only audit table.
DDoS Protection: Leverage Google Cloud Armor or a similar cloud WAF at the load balancer level as the first line of defense against volumetric attacks.
3. Infrastructure & Deployment
Staging Environment (Helm): Manage the staging environment's Kubernetes resources using a unified Helm chart. The CI/CD pipeline will be responsible for deploying to staging by overriding the image.tag value in the Helm chart.
Data Seeding: A scheduled GitHub Actions workflow will periodically refresh the staging database by restoring a sanitized backup from production.
Horizontal Scaling (HPA): Configure Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscalers for the API and Celery workers, triggered primarily by CPU utilization (>75%) and message queue depth (>1000 messages).
Database Scaling: The primary strategy is to use a managed Cloud SQL instance with vertical scaling. Read replicas will be added post-launch as performance dictates.
4. Compliance & Data Management
Strategy: Implement backend-centric services and automated jobs to handle data retention and user rights requests (GDPR/CCPA).
Data Retention: A daily Celery Beat task will trigger a job that iterates through data categories, applying retention policies (e.g., anonymizing analytics data after 2 years, deleting system logs after 90 days).
Right to Access/Erasure: Implement a ComplianceService. The "Export Data" feature will trigger an async Celery task to compile user data and send a secure download link. The "Delete Account" feature will perform a soft delete and schedule a hard delete task to run after a 30-day grace period.
Backup & Recovery (pgBackRest): Use pgBackRest with cron jobs for automated database backups (daily differential, weekly full) stored in a GCS bucket. Recovery will be tested via an automated weekly CI/CD pipeline that restores the latest backup to a temporary container and runs verification checks.
